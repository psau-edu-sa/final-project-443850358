## Tik Tok project
My team and I chose the Tik Tok program and explained the work plan in it so that we could start the project. We divided the work among ourselves and explained the functional and non-functional requirements and designed a UML diagram from the activity diagram and use case and Sequence diagram and class diagram .

Finally 
Tik Tok is a short video sharing app. You can record and edit videos and share them with the community.
